# Race Highlights Mobile

A mobile aspect page when events in a race series can be added and tracked to highlights of the event.

[Live Site](https://amesocker.github.io/Race-Highlights-Mobile/)

This site was created for a desire to keep track of all the highlight videos from different motor sports series in one place. 

There is no installation necessary. At the moment there is no delete function for individual events. To do so one would have to enter developer tools and delete the info from local storage.

## Usage

    Currently each event needs to be added manually. This is done by clicking on the plus symbol in the top right of the screen.
    Select the series, date, event/location, and session. Then click the add button.

    Once these are added they are saved to local storage. Upon re-load of the page all of the data is still present on the page including the watched checkmark.

## Future Development

A delete function for individual entries.
A function to collapse the add selections without adding an event.
Sort entries by series and date.
A separate view for watched and not watched entries.
An ics format import to populate table.
